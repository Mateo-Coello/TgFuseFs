## TgFuseFs
This project was implemented following the guide developed by Davoli, Sbaraglia, Lodi & Maffei from the University of Bolognia. The <br>
guide was introduced as a way for students to apply theoretical concepts from an operating systems class specifically a file system. <br>
The implmentation was made using Python 3.10, pyfuse 3.2.1 (fuse bindings for python), asyncio 3.4.3 (python library for asynchronous <br>
programming) and, telethon 1.25.0 (Telegram's API for python). The report of this project explains the basic notions of a file system and <br>
comments on the implementation aspects of the TgFuseFs. The steps to initialize the file system are both presented in the project report <br>
and in the demo video of the implementation. Recall that this implementation only works for distributions of Linux, with the one developed <br>
by Davoli et al. being tested under Ubuntu and this implementation being tested under Arch Linux. 

### Steps to initialize TgFuseFs
1. Obtain your **api_id** and **api_hash** for Telegram authentication using the following url: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id
2. Set the static variables **api_id** and **api_hash** of the class TgFuseWrapper to yours (obtained in the previous step) <br>
   within the *wrapper.py* file.
3. Execute the script *mktgfs.py* with your phone number as an argument as follows: *python3 mktgfs.py +[country-code][phone-number]*.
   For instance for a mexican phone number the script will be executed as follows: ***python3 mktgfs.py +524831212891***.
4. Create an empty directory to which the file system will be mounted, for instance: ***mkdir mnt***.
5. Execute tne script *tgfuse.py* with the directory name created and your phone number as arguments.
   For instance: ***python3 tgfuse.py mnt +524831212891***

Note: Watch the demo video of the implementation to know the functionalities of the file system. Only the commands presented are available,<br>
commands like *mv* or *cp* could be added but are not ready to use from the beggining.
